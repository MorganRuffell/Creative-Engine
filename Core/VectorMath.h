	This code is based on the work made in the Microsoft DirectX12 Math library, and 'Discrete Mathematics and it's applications' by by Kenneth H. Rosen
	
	It's based more on theoretical matrix and vector mathematics, commonly found in math textbooks
	I want this to be as close to what is inside of theoretical and math textbooks as possible.

	Creative for me was a learning exercise, for a bit of context I am a third year Games tech student.
