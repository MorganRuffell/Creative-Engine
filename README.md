# CreativePublicBranch
The public branch of Creative Engine, a DirectX12 Graphics Engine I'm building as my FMP for university.
The public branch on Github is exactly one month behind the Azure DevOps version that I'm working on, some code has been removed to protect some Intellectual property.

This is currently empty, as I update this! Please wait while I add in the new code.
